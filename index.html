            <h1>Hello there, reader.</h1>
            <p>I've been playing D&amp;D for a few years and I've made loads of characters. This is the backstory for one character I've made that was one of my favorite backstories. His name was Hector Jameson, a detective of the provence of Tal'Dorei.</p>

                    <p>My name is Hector Jameson. My Mother works at the Cobalt Reserve, a library of sorts that holds the history of our world, and my father is an Investigator. When i was younger my father taugh me about my grandfather, Alaxander. Alaxander mentored my father, but was also a murderer and was found guilty and sentenced to death. He escaped and is still on the run to this day. Later on in my young adult life i started working in Lyfyette's owned by Lyfyette Woods. He made the best pulled pork in all of Gwessar.</p>
                    <p>Tal'Dorei was suddenly hit with a serge of missing people in the area and was on total curfew. My father, along with other investigators, were asked to find out who was doing this and put a stop to them. My father, finally taking a mission that wasn't petty theft, said yes without a second though. This would prove fatal as he and his group also went missing. I had to figure out what happened to him so i signed up to the Security Academy.</p>
                    <p>At the security academy i met two life long friends who pushed me to be all i could. Lyn was a grade A student who was in teh top of the class before we graduated. Her skill were unlike anyone we've ever seen and she put me on my ass a few times. Along with being one of the smartest people i know, she was a real big help when it came to studying.</p>
                    <p>Hamond on the other hand was the complete opposite. He was a party animal, always ready for the next drink. Me and him were at the same level when it came to physical training, but i always had an eye for detail that he didn't have. After school was his time to shine as he always had a party set up to help us unwind.</p>
                    <p>Before graduations we've all been given our new positions in the city. Lyn was invited with the other top students to be a Royal Guard for the king, a job she wanted ever since she joined the academy. Hamond was to report for regular guard duty, but he was happy with it. At least he gets to drink all he wants after hours. I was giving the chance to join the Investigators and of course i took it. It's the only way i can get my hand on the case files for my father job. As graduation came and went we all went out separate ways. Onward to a better future i suppose.</p>
                    <p>I spent months working the same boring tasks my father worked before he went missing. I recieved a note infront of my door one morning from a man who claimed to be a friend of my father. His message read that he worked with him in the background before he went missing. Claims that he knows more about this disappearance than the Investigators do and he wants to meet me in Rutturbrine to discuss this matter further. I quickly found an excuse to leave my work for a few weeks and set out to Rutturbrine, in hopes that this man knew what happened to my father.</p>
